# CookingApp

## ‚ú® Preview of the Project

 One of the biggest challenges of adult life is deciding what to cook. 
 To help solve this issue, CookingApp was created. 
 This application allows users to save the recipes they prepare on a daily basis in a dynamic way. 
 You can store photos, ingredients and how your recipes are prepared, 
as well as having the option of randomly generating a recipe to cook, thus making the choice process easier.
